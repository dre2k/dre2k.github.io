## About

I am an analyst working in the genomics/genetic epidemiology field, primarily investigating interactions between genetic variants and environmental exposures. I use R for almost everything - [reproducible research](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [workflow management](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/), [presentations](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html). My github is a disorganized mess.
