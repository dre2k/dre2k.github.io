## About me 
My background is in Molecular Epidemiology, I'm currently in industry working with genetic data and machine learning models. 
Using this website as a public notebook to explore topics that interest me.  

I like spending time outdoors, contemplating our place in the world, silencing expectations imposed on me by myself or others and for a moment simply being present to take in the sights/sounds/smells. Incredibly, I have not yet pooped in the woods but hope to change that with future bike-packing trips. I spend a lot of time practicing musical instruments, I'm not excellent nor am I shit, which is perhaps a good description of me generally. I enjoy being part of a group that meshes well, generates excitement, and gets things done. Mental health is a wave, I'm increasingly forgiving myself for struggling with it sporadically.
