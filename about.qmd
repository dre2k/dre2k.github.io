## About Me

Hi there, I am a Genomic Data Scientist at AncestryDNA, interested in all things genetics, epidemiology, and machine learning.  

This is a personal website and I'm using it as a sandbox to write about random topics, document practice/toy analyses, take notes on self-study progress. My primary focus is skill development and growth, and connecting!
